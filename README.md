Job Boarding:

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Finding local, short-term jobs can be difficult for skilled tradespeople like maintenance workers, cleaners, plumbers, electricians, and painters.
Generalized job platforms fail to address the specific needs of these professionals and their potential clients. 
Homeowners and businesses also struggle to locate trustworthy, qualified workers quickly and affordably.

Goal:
To create a dedicated platform that connects skilled tradespeople with clients, providing an easy and efficient way to find, book, payment and manage short-term skilled labor opportunities.

Booking Flow Example
1. Client creates a job:
    * A client creates a job by filling out details like the title, description, and any specific requirements.
    * The job is stored with the client_id linking it to the client.
2. Professional sees available jobs:
    * Professionals (users with the PROFESSIONAL role) can view a list of jobs created by clients.
3. Client selects a professional:
    * Once the professional shows interest in a job, the client can view available professionals and choose one.
        * Once professional chose  isAvailability false;
    * This is done via a user interface where the client can select a professional.
4. Booking:
    * After the client selects the professional, the professional books the job.
    * A booking is created where the job is linked to the professional.

1. Confirmation:
    * The client confirms the booking, and the professional is booked for the job.
    * After create booking professional update status.(confirmed, in_process).
    * Professional able to see all the booking assign to himself.

Adjusted Workflow After Job Completion
1. Job Completion:
    * Once a job is marked as complete, the system allows the client to leave a review for the professional and the job.
    * A payment is also required to finalize the booking.
2. Review Process:
    * The client can leave a review based on the professional's performance and the quality of the job.
    * Each review is associated with both the job and the professional (via user).
3. Payment Process:
    * After job completion, a payment is processed for the job.
    * Each payment is linked to a specific booking.
    * Update professional = true;

SOFTWARE MODELING:
Include UML diagrams such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, or sequence diagrams as applicable.

ARCHITECTURE:
1. Presentation Layer (UI Layer)
    Purpose:
    Handles all interactions with the user, including collecting input, displaying output, and ensuring an intuitive user experience.
   Responsibilities:
    Display job listings and worker profiles.
    Handle user inputs (e.g., job posting, worker applications).
    Communicate with the business logic layer via RESTful APIs or service calls.
   Implementation:
    Frontend Framework: Use a combination of Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for server-side rendering and responsive design.
2. Business Logic Layer (Service Layer)
    Purpose:
    Encapsulates the core business logic, processes user requests, and enforces business rules.
   Responsibilities:
    Validate and process user actions (e.g., job postings, booking workers).
    Manage user sessions and roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user permissions).
    Interface with the data access layer for database operations.
   Implementation:
    Spring Service Classes:
     Write service classes that manage business logic.
     Annotate service classes with @Service.
3. Data Access Layer (DAO Layer)
    Purpose:
     Manages direct interactions with the database, handling CRUD operations and ensuring data integrity.
    Responsibilities:
     Provide a clean interface for data operations (repositories).
     Abstract raw database queries using an ORM (like JPA/Hibernate).
     Ensure database-related exceptions are handled gracefully.
    Implementation:
     Spring Data JPA Repositories:
      Use @Repository for defining data access interfaces.
      Create custom queries using JPQL or native SQL as needed.
4. Database Layer
    Purpose:
     Stores application data persistently, including user accounts, job listings, worker reviews, and bookings.
    Responsibilities:
     Define a normalized database schema to handle relationships.
     Support scalability with optimized indexing and queries.
    Implementation:
     Database Structure: MySQL database with tables like Users, Jobs, Categories, and Bookings.
5. Inter-Layer Communication
    Presentation to Business Logic:
     Use Spring MVC controllers annotated with @Controller or @RestController to expose endpoints for the UI layer.
6. Error Handling Across Layers
     Centralize error handling in the controller layer using Springâ€™s @RestControllerAdvice

ER DIAGRAM:
Include a detailed ER diagram showing your database structure and relationships.
